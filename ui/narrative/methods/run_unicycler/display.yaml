parameters :
    lib_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Reads library
        short-hint : |
            Reads libraries MUST HAVE Illumina/IonTorrent single, paired-end, and/or mate pair reads to use SPAdes.

    orientation:
        ui-name : |
            Relative orientation of read-pairs
        short-hint : |
            Two letter string for defining the relative orientation of the read pairs. Default is "fr" (forward-reverse) for paired-end libraries and "rf" (reverse-forward) for mate pair libraries.
    lib_type :
        ui-name : |
            Reads type
        short-hint : |
            Reads type for defining the reads in the parameter-group reads_libraries. Either "paired-end," "mate-pairs," "hq-mate-pairs," or "single."

    long_reads_ref :
        ui-name : |
            Long reads library
        short-hint : |
            Long reads libraries for running hybridSPAdes.

    long_reads_type :
        ui-name : |
            Long reads type
        short-hint : |
            Long reads type for defining the reads in the parameter-group long_reads_libraries. Either "pacbio_ccs," "pacbio_clr," "nanopore," "sanger," "trusted-contigs," or "untrusted-contigs."

    output_contigset_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output ContigSet Name
        short-hint : |
            The name for the resulting ContigSet that will be saved in KBase.

    min_contig_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Contig Length
        short-hint : |
            The shortest contig to accept in the resulting assembly object.

    dna_source :
        ui-name : |
            dna_source
        short-hint : |
            Bacteria or other organisms. This parameter is useful if you have too many Illumina jumping library mates. It sets the limit_jump_coverage to 60 for bacteria and 300 for the other organisms; cgwErrorRate to 0.25 for bacteria and 0.15 for the other organisms.

    pipeline_options :
        ui-name : |
            SPAdes pipeline options
        short-hint : |
            Options controlling how to run the SPAdes pipeline.

    kmer_sizes :
        ui-name : |
            K-mer Sizes
        short-hint : |
            Comma-separated list of k-mer sizes to be used. All values must odd, less than 128, and listed in ascending order. If --sc is set, the default values are 21,33,55.

parameter-groups :
    reads_libraries :
        ui-name : |
            Reads libraries to be assembled
        short-hint : |
            A group of reads libraries defined as reads_lib, orientation, reads_type.

    long_reads_libraries :
        ui-name : |
            Long reads for hybrid assembly
        short-hint : |
            A group of long reads libraries defined as long_reads_lib, long_reads_type.

    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for <a href="http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/"> HYBRIDSPADES: an algorithm for hybrid assembly of short and long reads</a>. This program constructs the assembly graph from short reads using SPAdes, then maps long reads to that assembly graph, using the consensus to close any gaps[2].</p>

    <p>SPAdes – St. Petersburg genome assembler – is an assembly toolkit containing various assembly pipelines. This <a href=”http://cab.spbu.ru/software/spades/”>manual</a> will help you to install and run SPAdes. SPAdes version 3.13.0 was released under GPLv2 on October 11, 2018.</p>

    <p>More information regarding the intricacies of HybridSPAdes can be found in the publications at the bottom of this App detail page.</p>
