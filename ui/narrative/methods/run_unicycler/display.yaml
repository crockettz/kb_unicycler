parameters :
    short_paired_libraries :
        ui-name : |
            Paired End Short Reads Library
        short-hint : |
            Unicycler requires at least one paired end short reads library

    short_unpaired_libraries :
        ui-name : |
            Unpaired Short Reads Library
        short-hint : |
	    Short unpaired reads libraries for running Unicycler (optional)

    long_reads_library :
        ui-name : |
            Long Reads Library
        short-hint : |
            Long reads library for running Unicycler (optional)

    output_contigset_name :
        ui-name : |
            Output ContigSet Name
        short-hint : |
            The name for the resulting ContigSet that will be saved in KBase.

    min_contig_length :
        ui-name : |
            Minimum Contig Length
        short-hint : |
            The shortest contig to accept in the resulting assembly object (default: 100)

    num_linear_seqs :
        ui-name : |
            Expected Number of Linear Contigs
        short-hint : |
            The expected number of linear (i.e. non-circular) sequences in the underlying sequence (default: 0)

    bridging_mode :
        ui-name : |
            Threshold for bridging contigs
        short-hint : |
            conservative = smaller contigs, lowest misassembly rate, normal = moderate contig size and misassembly rate, bold = longest contigs, higher misassembly rate (default: normal)

description : |
    <p>This is a KBase wrapper for <a href="https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler"> Unicycler, an assembly pipeline for bacterial genomes</a>. Unicycler can assemble Illumina-only read sets where it functions as a SPAdes-optimiser. It can also assembly long-read-only sets (PacBio or Nanopore) where it runs a miniasm+Racon pipeline. For the best possible assemblies, give it both Illumina reads and long reads, and it will conduct a hybrid assembly.

    <p>More details on Unicycler can be found in publication [1] at the bottom of this App detail page, and details of how it is used to assemble bacterial genomes can be found in publication [2].</p>
